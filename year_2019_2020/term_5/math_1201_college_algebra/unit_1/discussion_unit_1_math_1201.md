Since a relation is defined as "a set of points on a plane", both \( x \) and \( y \) are relations. But \( x \) cannot be seen as a function of \( y \) (or the inverse), because it violates the following rule: 
#### The vertical line test
A set of points in the plane represents \( y \) as a function of \( x \) if and only if no two points lie on the same vertical line (Stitz et al, 2011). Since it is a circle we are dealing with here, every point has a point that is directly opposing itself, and as a result, the equation \( x^2+(y-2)^2=1 \) fails the vertical line test, and in this particular situation, \( x\) cannot be considered a function of \( y \).

Although this part of the assignment is unclear as to what the "two functions" are, I will assume that they are the functions previously mentioned, \( g(y)=x \) and \( h(x)=y \). I find that both \( h(x) \) and \( g(y) \) are functions, both of them have the same domain which is, \( (-\infty,\infty) \). Both functions are graphed in the same manner only in different directions. Neither of the two functions has a line that reaches out to the point \( (0,2) \) by a distance of 1 unit. While the perimeter of the circle does relate to \( (0,2) \) by means of R, just not the point \( (0,2) \), itself.
