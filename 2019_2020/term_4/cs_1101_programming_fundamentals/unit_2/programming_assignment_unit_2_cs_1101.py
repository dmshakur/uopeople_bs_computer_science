Part 1:
    Write a function in this file called nine_lines that uses 
    the function three_lines (provided below) to print a total of nine lines
Part 2:
    Now add a function named clear_screen that uses a combination of the functions 
    nine_lines, three_lines, and new_line (provided below) to print a total of twenty-five lines.
    The last line of your program should call first nine_lines and then the clear_screen function.

    def new_line():
        print('.')
    def three_lines():
        new_line()
        new_line()
        new_line()

Submit your Python script file in the posting of your assignment. 
    Your Python script should be either a .txt file or a .py file.

You must execute your script and paste the output produced into a 
    document that you will submit along with your Python script.

It is very helpful if you print a placeholder between the printing 
    of 9 lines and the printing of 25 lines. It will make your output 
    easier to read for your peer assessors. A placeholder can be output 
    such as “Printing nine lines” or “Calling clearScreen()”.

The following items will be used in the grading rubric for this assignment.
    Make sure that you have addressed each item in your assignment.

Does the assignment implement new_line, three_lines, nine_lines, 
    and clear_screen functions, as well as a main section of the program which calls the functions?
Does the assignment demonstrate the use of nested function calls?
Does the assignment produce the appropriate output when executed?
    The output should be recorded in a text file, a Microsoft Word document, 
    or an RTF-formatted document by copying the output from the Python script into the document. 
    The successful script will print out 9 "." lines first and then 25 "." lines.
Does the program code include comments where appropriate?
