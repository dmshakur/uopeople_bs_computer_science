## Graphs of polynomials

A polynomial function is in the form:
$$ f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 $$
where $a_0,a_1,...,a_n$ are real numbers and $n\geq1$ is a natural number. The domain of a polynomial function is $(-\infty,\infty)$.

By definition a polynomial has all real numbers as its domain.

> Problem 3.1.1. Determine if the following functions are polynomials. Explain your reasoning.

1. Not a polynomial, has a variable as a denominator.
2. Not a polynomial, has a variable as as denominator.
3. Not a polynomial, has a variable as part of the denominator.
4. Not a polynomial, has a cube root.
5. Is a polynomial.
6. Is a polynomial.
