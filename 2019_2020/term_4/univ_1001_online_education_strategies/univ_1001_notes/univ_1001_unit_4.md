### How to Use Brainstorming Questions to Evaluate Ideas
When leaping into brainstorming, design, and production, it's probably a good idea to ask a few questions to clarify the vision behind the new solution.

Starbursting comes in when random questions lead to random answers, that are a chaotic mass of information unlikely to inform decision making or help clarify the projects vision, purpose, and process.

### What is starbursting
Starbursting is a twist on brainstorming that encourages team members to start creative juices flowing by asking questions rather than providing instant answers.

Starbursting starts with a star as a diagram, with each point in the star labeled with: who, what, where, why, when, and how. As many as 50 questions can be generated, once finished they need to be answered.

Starbursting can also be used to explore possibilities, philosophical directions or ideas. You can explore any concept in the star and start generating ideas.

#### Starbursting pros and cons
* Great technique for exploring an idea.
* Easy to generate focused questions that deserve answers.
* Generate questions that may not come up otherwise.
* Not intended as a tool for planning.

### How to starburst
1. Draw the star.
2. In the center of the star goes the topic, issue, product, idea or concept.
3. Write a one word question on each start point: who, what, when, where, why and how.
4. Brainstorm questions that start with each word in each star point.
5. Brainstorm questions until you have enough to facilitate a discussion, the article recommends 3.
6. Systematically answer the questions, and write down short versions of each question next to their respective point.

#### Managing questions
Keep on task and focused without devolving into long winded discussions for individual questions early on.

Be careful when asking questions that could potentially derail the discussion.

If non-relevant questions come up they can be added to another list to be tackled at a different time.

#### Managing people
Starbursting can be a time when people that like to hear their own voices try and dominate the discussion.

Techniques to mitigate such issues include:
* Using a timer.
* Call on anyone that hasn't yet spoken.
* Go around the room as you go around the star.
* Have everyone write their own questions down then collect them.
* Have two separate meetings for asking and answering.

#### Managing time
Starbursting can take a lot of time. The challenge is to make sure that every question is answered.

Strategies for managing time:
* Limit time available for each portion of the process. Five minutes per question, three minutes for addressing each question, etc.
* Limit the number of questions for each star.
* Create a group for each point in the star.
* Post the chart in a common space for everyone to see and write questions on.

### Variations on starbursting
Instagram used a similar technique for identifying the major issues with mobile photography.

They brain storm a set of questions to consider then select three to focus on. After lengthy discussion they were able to pinpoint the three most significant issues related to mobile photography at the time, lackluster photos, long upload times, and share-ability.

They then developed a set of actionable corporate statements.
1. Vision: We want all of our user's photos to upload to our app seamlessly, looking exceptionally beautiful, where they can all comment and share without any distractions.
2. Issue statement: Today, too many apps capture poor photos that miss the photographers vision. It takes too long to upload photos via text message, making it difficult to share.
3. Method: Discover the final needs of users with a human-centered design process. Lean methods will help up constantly improve our product.

The end of this story is, of course, common knowledge. Instagram was able to build one of the world’s foremost mobile photography sharing sites and apps in the world, demonstrating how powerful a process of deeper questioning can be.

### Summarization
* Starbursting is a form of brainstorming that focuses on questions before answers.
* It is conducted with the use of a six sided star, each point is assigned one question.
* Participants generate questions starting with each point's word.
* Multiple questions are generated for each point.
* Questions are addressed by the group.
* It is more complex than it seems and should be managed by a facilitator.
* It's a good way to generate and consider ideas, but not a solution for creating a plan of action.

(n.d.)

If you only fix the symptoms of an issue, what you see on the surface, the underlying problem will almost certainly return and need fixing over and over again. However if you look deeper to figure out what's causing the problem, you can fix the underlying systems and processes so that it goes away for good.

Root cause analysis, is a often used technique to answering why a problem occurred in the first place. It uses a specific set of tools to identify the origin of a problem.
1. Determine what happened.
2. Determine why it happened.
3. Figure out what to do to reduce the likelihood that it will happen again.

RCA assumes that systems and events are interrelated. An action in one area triggers an action in another. By tracing backwards through actions, you can discover where it started and how it grew into the issue your facing.

There are three basic types of causes.
1. Physical: Tangible, material items failed in some way.
2. Human causes: People did something wrong, or did not do something that was needed. Human causes typically lead to physical causes.
3. Organizational causes: A system, process or policy that people use to make decisions or do their work is faulty. i.e. People making assumptions that something is being done by someone else when it is in fact not.

RCA involves investigating the patterns of negative effects, finding hidden flaws in the system, and discovering specific actions that contributed to the problem. RCA can reveal more than one root cause.

> Use good judgement and common sense to determine how far back into previous actions you should go into determining a problem. You can trace an issue as far back into history if you want, but that will likely serve no purpose

### The root cause analysis process
1. Define the problem:
    * What do you see happening?
    * What are the specific symptoms?

2. Collect data:
    * What proof do you have that the problem exists?
    * How long has the problem existed?
    * What is the impact of the problem?

A full analysis is necessary to understand the situation fully. Include any and all parties involved who understand the situation. People who are most familiar with the problem can help lead you to a better understanding of the issues. 

CATWOE is a helpful tool for this process which helps look at different perspectives.
* C: Customers
* A: Actors, who implement the solutions
* T: Transformation, the process that is affected
* W: World view
* O: Owner, of the process
* E: Environmental constraints

3. Identify possible causal factors:
    * What sequence of events leads to the problem?
    * What conditions allow the problem to occur?
    * What other problems surround the occurrence of the central problem?
During this stage identify as many causal factors as possible. People often identify only a few factors and then stop, this is not sufficient. You want to dig deeper than simply treating the most obvious cases.

Tools for determining causal factors:
* Use the facts and ask "So what?" to determine all possible consequences of a fact.
* Ask "Why?" until you get to the root of the problem.
* Break down a problem into small, detailed parts to better understand the big picture.
* Cause and effect diagrams: Create a chart of all the possible causal factors, to see where the trouble may have begun.

4. Identify the root cause(s):
    * Why does the casual factor exist?
    * What is the real reason the problem occurred?
Use the tools to identify causal factors to look at the roots of each factor.

5. Recommend and implement solutions:
    * What can you do to prevent the problem from happening again?
    * How will the solution be implemented?
    * Who will be responsible for it?
    * What are the risks of implementing the solution?

Analyze your process, plan ahead to predict the effects of your solution.

### Key points
Figure out what negative events are occurring. Then look at the complex systems around these problems and identify key points of failure. Finally, determine solutions to address those key points, or root causes.

RCA is an essential tool for performing comprehensive, system wide review of significant problems as well as the events and factors that lead to them.

### Release time
(n.d.)

Our understanding of something is dependent upon the situation and ourselves. This varies widely. People will interpret events and situations differently and pay attention to different aspects of what is happening. The ladder of inference is a model of the steps used to make sense of situations in order to act. It helps with meta-cognition and with coordinating our thoughts with other people.

### Available data:
All directly observable data, such as speech, tone of voice, body movement, reports statistical surveys etc.

#### Example:
Karen responds to your suggestion by pausing a moment and then saying, "That sounds like a rational approach."

### Select data:
We can't pay attention to everything so we make conscious choices about what data to use and what to ignore. This process usually occurs subconsciously.

#### Example:
You say to yourself, "Karen is saying that there is a problem with my suggestion. While it is rational, it does not address the emotions involved."

### Name what is happening:
This continues the interpretation process by classifying what is happening into a more general category.

#### Example:
You characterize Karen's actions as "Having doubts about my suggestion and covering them up."

### Explain or evaluate what is happening:
Draw on a stock of causal theories to explain why what happened is. And/or evaluate is by drawing on our value system to determine a positive or negative state.

#### Example:
You make the assessment that "Karen is uncomfortable with conflict and is politely preventing us from being of more help to her.

### Decide what to do:
We use our repertoire fo actions to decide what to do based on our explanations or evaluations of what is happening.

#### Example:
You decide to stop offering suggestions.

### Reflexive loop:
Our assumptions, values, and beliefs influence how we select data, interpret what is happening, and decide what to do. 

Our interpretations and decisions then feedback to reinforce (usually) our assumptions, values, and beliefs. 

We act on the basis of our interpretations, and our actions affect what data is available to us. 

Our ways of understanding and acting in the world create a self-reinforcing system, insulating us from alternative ways of understanding.

### Using the ladder:

#### The impacts of jumping up the ladder
* Our own conclusions seem obviously right to us.
* People can and do reach different conclusions. When they each view their own conclusions as obvious, they don't see a need to say how they reached them.
* People see different conclusions of others as obviously wrong, and invent reasons to explain why others say things that are so obviously wrong.
* When People disagree, they often hurl conclusions at each other from the top of their respective ladders.

#### General guidelines
* Notice your conclusions as conclusions based on your inferences, not as self-evident facts.
* Assume your reasoning process could have gaps or errors that you do not see.
* Use examples to illustrate the data you select that led to you conclusions.
* Paraphrase (out loud) the meanings you hear in what others say, so that you can check if you are understanding correctly.
* Explain the steps in your thinking that takes you from the data you select and the meanings you paraphrase to the conclusions you reach.
Ask others if they have other ways of interpreting the data or if they see gaps in your thinking.
* Assume that others may reach different conclusions because they have their own ladder of inference with a logic that makes sense to them.
* Ask others to illustrate the data they select and the meanings they paraphrase.
* Ask others to explain the steps in their thinking.

### What is critical thinking?
In short critical thinking is more than understanding something - it involves evaluation, critiquing, and a depth of knowledge that surpasses the subject itself and expands outward. It requires problem-solving, creativity, rationalization, and a refusal to accept things at face value.

It's a willingness and ability to question everything.

## College success, chapter 3: Thinking about thought

#### Where are you now?
Assess your present knowledge and attitudes.
* Yes: I am a good problem solver
* N/A: I am considered creative by my friends.
* Yes: I have good judgment.
* Yes: I find it easy to make decisions quickly.
* Unsure: My decisions usually turn out to be good decisions.
* Yes: I like to think things through before speaking.
* Yes: I am not shy about asking questions when I don’t understand something.
* Yes: I enjoy good discussions and arguments.
* No, unless coding counts, which I doubt: I regularly practice an art form (music, acting, painting, etc.)
* Yes: I enjoy hearing other people’s points of view, even when I disagree with them.
* Yes & no, Depending on the source: I usually question information presented as fact on the Internet or television

#### Where do you want to go?
Think about how you answered the questions above. Be honest with yourself. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent), how would you rate your level of thinking skills at this time.

The three most important areas in which I think I can improve:
* Analyzing information.
* Thinking critically.
* Asking questions about information.

#### It's all in your head.
College life is different from high school there are different pressures involved. The two most fundamental differences involve expectations - the expectation that you'll be independent, taking responsibility for your actions and having to think for yourself.

Thinking in high school is very structured and tied closely with what is taught in class, where students typically memorize information. (This seems like a very poor model)

Higher order thinking skills while hardly used in high school are necessary for real success in college. Your success in college and in life is ultimately tied to being a better and more complete thinker, utilizing critical and creative thinking skills. These skills require consistent practice to master.

### 3.1 Types of thinking
#### Learning Objectives:
* Understanding that there are different types of thinking.
* Identify how each type of thinking contributes to learning.

Benjamin Bloom developed a classification of thinking skills that are still useful today, known as Bloom's taxonomy. There are six ranked in order of knowledge, complexity, comprehension, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. 

#### Thinking skills and what they involve:
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * Retrieving or repeating information or ideas from memory. This is the first and most basic thinking skill you develop.
2. Understanding:
    * Interpreting, constructing meaning, inferring, or explaining material from written, spoken, or graphic sources. Reading is the most common understanding, these skills are developed starting with early education.
3. Applying:
    * Using learned material or implementing material in new situations. This skill is commonly used starting in middle school.
4. Analyzing:
    * Breaking material or concepts into key elements and determining how the parts relate to one another or to an overall structure or purpose. Mental actions included in this skill are examining, contrasting or differentiating, separating, categorizing, experimenting or deducing. You most likely started developing this skill in high school and will continue to practice it in college.
5. Evaluating:
    * *Assessing*, *making judgments*, and *drawing conclusions* from ideas, information, or data. *Critiquing* the value and usefulness of material. This skill encompasses most of what is commonly referred to as critical thinking, this skill will be called on frequently during your college years and beyond. Critical thinking is the first focus of this chapter.
6. Creating:
    * *Putting parts together* or *reorganizing* them in a new way, form, or product. This process is the most difficult mental function. This skill will make you stand out in college and is in very high demand in the workforce. Creative thinking is the second focus of this chapter.

All of these skills are important for college work and real world applications. The mid-level skills will be practiced a lot in college. While the higher thinking skills are the most demanding, and you will need to invest focused effort to develop them.

#### Exercise: thought inventory
Identify in the past weeks of school work where and how you used the previously listed thinking skills.
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * I'm actually not very good at this one. I often go to do something and forget what it is I set out to do.
2. Understanding:
    * A very important skill, I utilize different kinds of note taking to cement information followed by using it to further understand.
3. Applying:
    * Similar to the Understanding section, in order to understand things like machine learning and deep learning libraries, I simply use them and apply the knowledge. Trying things out increases ability on a subject.
4. Analyzing:
    * I use this whenever I debug code I write. I will write a program or script, get an error message and have to work my way through the code and find what went wrong and how to fix it. I also use this skill when working with data and how best to process it and use it to achieve the goal of making accurate predictions.
5. Evaluating:
    * I do this when the best course of action in my life and education. Which requires a great deal of effort and thought, as there are many possible roads and combinations of paths that can be taken. One must ensure that the right paths are taken, with the right amount of time and effort spent on each.
6. Creating:
    * I don't use this as much. I will use it however when writing code, such as when I wrote a C++ program of a neural network. I had to identify how to use my knowledge on neural networks and create one that could process data and come out with a prediction that was useful.

#### Verbs signifying the use of specific critical thinking skills
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * Bookmark, count, describe, draw, enumerate, find, google, identify, label, list, match, name, quote, recall, recite,search, select, sequence, tell, write
2. Understanding:
