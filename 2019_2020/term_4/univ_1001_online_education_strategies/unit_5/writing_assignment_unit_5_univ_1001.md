After reviewing this weekâ€™s readings, assess your readiness to be a self-directed learner. In your response, make sure to address the following:

What is a self-directed learner? What are the essential aspects of self-directed learning?

A self-directed learner is someone who takes their education into their own hands, decides how and when to do it, and has the discipline to see it through. Some of the most important aspects of self-learning are but not limited to, discipline, driver, determination, focus, self-control, knowing what you need to learn, and being able to implement what you are learning. 

What are your two biggest strengths as a student? How will these strengths help you become a self-directed learner?

Perseverance and planning. I persevere and accomplish my goal no matter what. I know what I want out of my education, there is no guesswork, it is only a matter of what is financially feasible. Perseverance is important because without it we would all give up when it gets hard and although times get hard I don't ever give up on my "strategic objective". As far as planning goes, I am not one of those people that doesn't know what they want and how they want to live their life. I know almost exactly what I want in life and in education therefore all that's left is to do the work.

What are your two biggest weaknesses as a student? How do these affect your readiness to be a self-directed learner?

My biggest weaknesses are having a poor learning environment and occasional lack of focus which worsens with exercise. The parts of my environment that affect my ability to learn are issues that I am always trying to fix, but due to financial feasibility that are not always changeable. Namely, having a part-time job provides stress and distraction that tarnishes my ability to focus on education, as well as the amount of time I can spend with it. Another environmental issue being having roommates and nowhere I can go to effectively study. As far as lack of focus goes, whenever I exercise it always seems to make working more difficult, especially right afterward. Outside of exercise sometimes for what seems to be no apparent reason, I can't for the life of me focus on work. There are times when I try to accomplish a certain task and find my mind running to find any other thing on planet earth to think about. 

Describe at least three strategies to become a more self-directed learner. How will you hold yourself accountable for your growth as a learner?

This is a difficult query, one that I have a few years of stress-induced experience with. Holding yourself completely accountable for your education is hard, especially if you've never taken that kind of responsibility before. One of my main strategies for being/becoming a self-directed learner is putting everything else on hold, which is a difficult thing to do. Truly taking control of your education entails making sacrifices of the things that don't help you work or take away your ability to work. Another is note-taking. Generally, when I read something, I hardly remember anything. Just like in the cones of learning, where it is noted that only 10% of information is retained while reading. This is situational and subjective to the topic of which I am reading about. Typically if I read something related to artificial intelligence, I can retain pretty well, but if it's a topic I don't really care for or have almost no real interest in, it will take an enormous amount of self-control. When I run into this particular issue I try to take notes if I can. 

Your written assignment should be submitted in a Word document (or similar program) and should be at least 1-2 pages in length, double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and written in Times New Roman size 12 font.  You should provide a word count at the end of your written assignment.

Note to graders: As my laptop is broken I have to use the text editor on my phone, and am unable to format my text properly.
