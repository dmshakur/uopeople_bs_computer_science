### 1. We know that using netiquette online is important, but why? What are the consequences of bad netiquette in the classroom? In your response, be sure to reflect on how it feels to be addressed with bad netiquette, and how you think others feel.

### 2. How does netiquette relate to peer assessment? Why is it important to use good manners when leaving feedback? 

### 3. How do you feel about the feedback you received this week? What about the feedback you gave? 

#### Part 1
The importance of netiquette is as important as etiquette offline. If we do not have attitudes with respect for other people the class environment will likely become corrupted and learning will suffer as a result. So when you talk to other people through internet services you must be respectful, you also have a responsibility to look over your work and determine whether or not it can be taken out of context. Poor netiquette is not always negative feed back however. As Mintu-Wimsatt et al. (2010) writes that if a class room environment is met with excessive pleasantries and is lacking in critical feedback (pp. 264-267). This can hinder the students ability to learn as critical feedback is absolutely needed for improvement and is a part of life that students will need be familiar with after graduation, as well as in and out of the classroom.

#### Part 2
I found myself reviewing someone's work for a discussion response and I had to rewrite my post a few times over. Because I was being critical I wanted to be sure that I didn't rub my classmate the wrong way, originally I was going to give a negative review and point out their mistakes, instead I decided to let them know what they were doing wrong and to give them some words of encouragement on what they could do to improve. Using good manners is crucial to propagating an emotionally healthy classroom. When people in a classroom feel like they can be more open with each other and show respect, all the students are encouraged to talk to each other more. As written by, Mintu-Wimsatt et al. (2010), the "discourse" resulting from positive interaction can lead to a "productive" "learning experience" (p. 264).

#### Part 3
When I give feedback to others on their work I try to give them some positive and negative points as well as find some way to relate to their work as well. It is always my hope that when I tell someone what I think about their paper they are able to take what I told them in a positive light and derive meaningful information that can be used to grow. I feel the same way about receiving feedback but in reverse. Whenever I get feedback, I want to hear something honest, insightful, respectful and informative. Feed back is really important, especially in the process of learning something new. Having a good base of foundational knowledge to fall back on is very beneficial and with that feedback is important.
