## Part 1
There are two parts of this equation that need to be considered when finding the domain. The first is that we cannot get the square root of a number less than \( 0 \), and the second is we cannot have the denominator of a fraction to be equal to \( 0 \). Both square root operations in this equation are being subtracted from, so then \( x \) must be a value that is either equal to or greater then the largest number we are getting the difference from, out of both negatives \( 6 \) is the largest, so \( x\leq6 \). Since the second square root is getting the difference of \( x \) and 4 we don't need to consider its impact since, \( x\leq6 \), and any number that conforms to that specification will not create a number less than or equal to \( 0 \). Therefore the domain of \( f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x-6}}{\sqrt{x-4}} \) is \( [6,\infty) \).

## Part 2
\( h(x)=\frac{1}{x}3\frac{\sqrt{\frac{x}{81-x^{2}}}}{45-x^{2}}+-1x\left{-10<x<10\right} \)
Domain of \( h(x) \): \( (-10,0)\cup(0,\sqrt{45})\cup(\sqrt{45},9) \)

## Part 3
The cost in dollars of making \( x \) items is given by the function \( C(x) = 10x + 500 \).
1. $500.00
2. $750.00
3. Domain: \( [0,100] \), Range: \( [500,1500] \)
