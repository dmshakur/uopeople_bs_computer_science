Getting a different perspective is one of best ways to increase your field of view on a topic, as 
well as notify you of any deficiencies you might have on any given topic. Often when we separate ourselves from
others we tend to decrease or limit our potential. If we then decide to create a community that is focused on and 
geared towards collaborative education, you never cease to have a shoulder to lean on. This is where UoPeople comes into play,
with UoPeople, being a part of discussion assignments of every class every week is a requirement, with that we all have the opportunity to learn soft skills that you might not always have the opportunity to learn in a traditional environment. With a peer review system, and
the discussion assignments (like this one), we all get the opportunity to spend time looking at other peoples work, 
their ideas and thought processes, and then we can take that new found knowledge and use it for ourselves and find things out that we may
not have discovered otherwise.
