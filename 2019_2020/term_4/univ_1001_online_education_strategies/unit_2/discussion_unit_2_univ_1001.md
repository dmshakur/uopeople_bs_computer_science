## Part 1

### Is writing easy for you, or difficult? Why?

Writing is easy when the topic being written about is something I care for and am knowledgeable about. I think that a part of being able to write well is being honest and open to the page or keyboard that's in front of you. Discomfort and feeling unsure about your writing ability usually leads to writer's block. 
Although there are plenty of times when I have difficulty writing, and this is usually the majority of the time spent writing. When it comes to writing Except for programming I have very little experience with the subject, as a result I have less of an ability to structure and formulate my thoughts well into writing. With more practice, feedback, and by reading other people's work to see how they formulate their ideas, I will in turn be better at formulating mine.

## Part 2

### What strategies are helpful for college-level writing assignments? How do you start your assignments that require a lot of writing?

An important strategy for getting the words in your text editor is to outline what you are going to write. Finding a time that you can set aside to focus on the topic, instead of starting without any kind of planning can save you a lot of headaches from being unprepared. College Success (2015) the author says that "Students who take the time to plan actually write longer in-class assays than those who begin their answer right after they have read the assignment"(p.290-291). Planning and making sure you have a process you can stick to are crucial for the quality of your work and that your time spent on the assignment is spent well.

Last week was my first foray into college writing, so I can only speculate as to how I'd start writing for an assignment. With my lack of experience I'll do my best to speculate as to what I will do in my future. An important part of answering an assignment's question or problem is understanding it, which can sometimes be difficult in more advanced writing since the wordage can often be vague for someone that doesn't have experience interpreting it. Once you have a good understanding of the question you can begin formulating ideas and a strategy for the way you'll answer the question. I find being in a logical frame of mind helps.

## Part 3

### When you write, what is the difference between writing a paper and writing a discussion post? What is the difference between writing an initial discussion post and a response to one of your classmates?

Writing a paper is meant to be a stand-alone piece of information that describes it's topic to readers in a way to help them fully understand what it presents. A discussion post however is meant as a communicative learning tool that promotes scholarly discourse. When you write a paper you will likely take a substantial amount of time, several hours at the least, to study the subject and collect materials to present your topic in a clear and precise manner. You'll want your findings and ideas to be fully formed in a way that you won't have space for in a discussion post. Your post should be smaller to propagate conversation When participating in a discussion which gives everyone a chance to speak and read each other's posts. They both have strengths and weaknesses, but they complement each other's weak points.

When you write an initial discussion post you're writing a very tiny paper, meant to have fully formed opinions while exploring the assignment and instigating interest. But they are also bite-sized enough so that people can digest yours and several other peoples as well. When you follow up on someone's initial post, you are giving them a review and your thoughts on what they said as well. When following up you aren't meant to write as much as you would in an initial post since you might only focus on one section of their writing instead of everything they covered. Here, you're making conversation and strengthening your verbal skills. Saint Leo University (2016) writes about the benefits of online learning and discussion forums and the benefits they have over in-person classes. I haven't been to a physical college myself but I can see how people would fall through the cracks and how that is mitigated with discussion assignments (https://www.saintleo.edu/blog/20-tips-for-writing-an-a-discussion-post-for-your-online-program-class). I would speculate discipline comes into play a lot more with an online class than with in-person classes, as you have to decide when you get your work done.
