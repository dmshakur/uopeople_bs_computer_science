## Part 1:
#### Questions
* Q1: What schools were chosen from the population?
* Q2: You could have easily chose schools that are all very similar to each other and therefore the solution you presented would has a serious validity issue where you're projected results are based on a drop of water in a bucket. 
* Q3: What is the mean and median score for each school when compared to the rest of the nation. 
* Q4: What methods of collecting data did you use?
* Q5: I personally don't believe that four schools are enough, and can't represent properly the wide range of schools in my nation, the US.
* Q6: What kind of schools are we talking about here, kindergarten, grade schools, all pre-college educational environments, colleges, vocational schools, online schools or maybe special education programs for people with disabilities, heck there are even military schools. Obviously there are a very wide range of schools in the population and the ones I've just listed show that there far more than four ways in representing our school system.
* Q7: Was there a particular kind of student that was positively effected by this new program?
* Q8: If we were to create a distribution representing those that had further increased scores and those that had further decreased scores then would the data be skewed in a particular direction or towards a particular trait or race or some other attribute?

#### Comments
* C1: I don't think that this is very wise at all. We cannot achieve the accuracy of measurement that we need to make a decision of such magnitude as noted by Yakir in Introduction to statistical thinking. If we want to find a normal distribution we should use as much data as we can muster. In this particular situation there is hardly any data at all. I would go so far as to say that we cannot possibly represent the population fo my country fairly with such claims. In other countries maybe, especially smaller countries. But still I think that this is a lazy attempt at gathering funding and there need to be a larger amount, or any amount, of statistical analysis.
* C2: In my country we have a system in place for our government called the house of representatives. This system is a party of political contributers that have a varying amount pre state. I would advise following a similar method of collecting data for a project like this. Not every state is created equal and some are much larger than others, and some have massive populations to boot, like New York or California. If we were to follow a smiliar distribution for collecting data we should, we would likely have a much fairer sample, since the population is sampled more appropriately.
* C3: Even so it may be necessary to use sampling techniques per state to determine what kinds of schools to sample from. Then again you could also hold a 'lottery' where each educational institution is given equal chance to be a statistical representative for their state. Or for what I think would be a better sample method, would be to sample the data from schools that are most in need of a educational rehabilitation.

## Part 2:
Whether the program will increase the scores or not is almost irrelevant to me. If this whole program is based on four samples that can most certainly not fully represent the population then its success will be random, if you were to ask me. You could easily go anywhere in the world and find anything that would work on a small portion of a population, you can't base decisions unfounded on data, or at least what I would consider to be enough data. A side note that I personally don't think that a range of 0.5 to 2.5 points is all that much, maybe we should try to go big here instead of settle for a few meager points.
