## Sampling and data structures

### The sampled data
The aim in statistics is to learn the characteristics of a population on the basis of a sample from the population. An essential part of this analysis involves consideration of variation in the data.

#### Variation in data
To some extent the assessment of variation and the quantification of its contribution to uncertainties in making inference is the statisticians main concern. 

Be aware that if an investigator collects data, the data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. However, if two investigators or more are taking data from the same source and get very different results, it is time to reevaluate their data-collection methods and data recording accuracy.

#### Variations in samples
A sample is often called the number of observations. Random sampling is exactly what it sounds like, sampling from the population at random. Cluster sampling is where one would take parts of a population, like an entire state or and entire classroom of people. If both methods for sampling are used they will probably have different outcomes, if larger sample sizes are taken then the outcome will likely come closer to what the real average is, while still likely having different outcomes. 

#### Frequency
A frequency is the number of times a given datum occurs in a data set. The outcome of dividing an object by a number is a division of each element in the object by the given number. This operation gives us the relative frequencies, which should always sum up to equal 1.

The cummulative relative frequency is the accumulation of previous relative frequencies. To find the cumulative relative frequency of the current value. Alternatively we may apply the function "cumsum" to the sequence of relative frequencies.
