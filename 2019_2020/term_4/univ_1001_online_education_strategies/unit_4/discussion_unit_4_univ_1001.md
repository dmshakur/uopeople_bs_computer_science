## Part 1:
According to College Success (2015) critical thinking is evaluation and the process of working through a problem with objectivity (p. 102). To properly utilize your critical thinking skills you need to first identify what problem your trying to solve. From there you come up with solutions and find some way to test them when you do find a solution or a problem you don't stop looking for them. There are often multiple answers, problems, and perspectives in any given issue. It can be a difficult process and sometimes there will be issues with your logic and things that you are not seeing. This is where group brainstorming comes into play. Getting together with a group to solve a problem is a great way of an issue. Using the starburst technique (2016) with a group will undoubtedly bring you to your goal faster. Although in such a situation it is wise to keep a mediator to ensure everyone gets to put their thoughts forward, and no one dominates the conversation. After studying critical thinking, as well as other methods of thought, I have determined that it is a vital skill for my career's success. This unit in particular feels the most relevant to my future by far, and I hope to get better and better at cultivating this new skill.

## Part 2:
I understand why employers want people who can get think critically. Not a lot of people want someone hired that can't think outside the box and go beyond that they might have learned in school. The real world is full of the unexpected, and college can't train you for everything. If you hired someone and they couldn't handle tasks outside their norm and were not able to problem solve, that person would become a liability. Employers want people who can pull their weight and make a meaningful contribution to the company. As to whether or not they are justified I would say, yes they are. According to Allison Doyle (2019) and College Success (2015), critical thinking skills one of the most in-demand skills that a person can have. In today's world, we have major changes happening to our culture, technology, and way of life happening all the time. With this constant environment of change it is necessary to be able to adapt, and solve new problems.
