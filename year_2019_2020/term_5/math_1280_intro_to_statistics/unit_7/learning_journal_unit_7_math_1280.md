## Part 2:
A. A sampling distribution is a space of random variables that could be selected for whatever purpose you choose (Yakir, 2011).

B. The law of large numbers states that the more data points we have the more the data will be concentrated about the expectation, (Yakir, 2011). This was also stated by Yakir (2011) when he spoke of our need for a greater number of observations with a normal distribution.  

## Part 3:


3) Describe in your own words (do not directly quote any source) the difference between the distribution of a sample and the sampling distribution.  Use an example in which the original population has a binomial distribution.  You will probably use concepts from the book or another source, so be sure to cite any concepts that come from such sources (even if you paraphrase).
