### Tip: Identifying stress
Identify any stressors by looking at your habits, excuses and attitude to see if there is anything that contributes to stress. Determine whether or not to get rid of it.

Stress is an automatic response from the central nervous system, caused by environmental and internal factors generally relating to emotion or perception of physical interactions such as pain and movement.

Half of all freshmen don't make it to graduation. Financial difficulties and falling behind on studying are the two biggest factors in dropping out of college.

### 2.1, Setting and reaching goals:
A goal is a result that we intend to reach usually through our actions. Attitude and motivation play an important role in education. An important step is to think about setting goals and organizing your priorities.

Goals can shift and change over time. Larger goals should be a driving force behind medium sized goals and those goals are the driving force behind small goals.

Goals should be realistic, specific, have a time frame and you should really want to reach that goal.

If you're doing something because of some outside force, for example seeking someone else's approval, you may want to rethink them.

#### Priorities
The question of prioritizing your goals with what you want to is not that you shouldn't do what you want, its that you should do it when you can. Be timely when you do things that are not a part of your responsibilities. A priority is what is most important at the moment. You will have time for everything when you manage your time well. Time management only work when you are dedicated and committed.

#### An attitude for success
A positive attitude can lead to success while a negative attitude will likely do the opposite. Your attitude is a choice and it will have an impact on your goals.

#### Be more upbeat with yourself
Remain positive even with yourself.

#### Choose whom you spend time with
Don't surround yourself with negative people who just cry like babies when things go wrong.

#### Overcome resistance to change
Dwelling on the differences between you and other people can lead to having a negative attitude towards college and all the different people in it.

#### Overcome fears
A common fear of college students is the fear of failure. 

#### Stay focused and motivated
* Think about and focus on your goals.
* Vocalize your current goal or whatever you're trying to accomplish.
* Remember and savor past successes.
* Focus on what is happening right now.
* Don't multi-task when studying, doing things like checking your email can lower the quality of your study time.
* If you see someone else doing better than you it might be a good idea to analyze their actions and implement some of their strategies for working to make your college experience better.
* Distance yourself from unsuccessful people, and people that always put everything off until the last minute.
* If you complete a task successfully, reward yourself.
* Some people work not to fail instead of working for a reward.
* Get the important things done first.

#### Network for success
Just about anything worth doing in life requires work of more than one person. Finding other students that have similar goals can have immediate effects such as the ability to have a better understanding of the course material and ability to clarify information. Networking can also have potential benefits in the future.

#### Problem solving: When setbacks happen
The difference between people who succeed in solving a problem and someone who gives up is part attitude and experience. Taking steps to minimize or prevent issues from occurring down the line is the best way to stay prepared for unseen problems. Stay motivated, focused and don't let negative thoughts get in the way of success. Consider all possible solutions to your problem. 

After solving a problem be honest with yourself about how to avoid it in the future. Take responsibility for your actions. Make a plan and stick to it. 

#### Key takeaways
Be committed to your goals. Set priorities. Have a good attitude. Network with other students. Plan well. Know how to solve a problem.

### 2.2 Organizing your space
I order to have the best attitude for studying it is important to organize your space and time. Have your own space where you feel comfortable, secure and in control. You can reinforce habits by using certain places for certain things. Different places create different moods and can have a corresponding effect on your ability to study.

#### Use space to your advantage and to avoid distractions
Choose a place to study that has a suitable environment. That place should be available whenever you need it. Your study space should have everything that you need, like outlets. It should meet your psychological needs as well. The more you use a particular space for studying the better accustomed you will become to it and the easier it will be to study. Keep your area organized and free of distractions. Take breaks on occasion.

#### The distractions of technology
Multi-tasking with tech can lead to a decrease in attention spent on your studies. It takes longer to do anything if you're doing something else at the same time. Science has shown that people that shift from one thing to another quickly and often form pathways in the brain that lead to a decreased ability to focus on one thing.

#### Family and roommate issues
Plan ahead when studying in environments that could be intrusive.

### 2.3 Organizing your time
The optimal time for you to study may vary depending on the time of day. Do you function better staying up late or getting up early? Logging how you spend your time for an entire week may surprise you with how you spend your time.

#### Time management
For every hour in the classroom college students should on average study for about two hours. The goal of time management is that one should be able to get everything they need done, done, and still be able to find time to do other things they want to do.
