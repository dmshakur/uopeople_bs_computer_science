## Part 1:
The note-taking strategy I have been using for a while now is outlining. I don't use paper so it makes relational maps less effective or any note-taking strategy that isn't linear Paper is nice but I don't like the idea of purchasing something that isn't reusable unless I need it. I do think that the Cornell method is interesting however, and widely recommended by colleges & professors (College Success, 2015). I've been thinking about writing a program for note-taking that might be similar to the Cornell method which I think could be really beneficial.

## Part 2:
The note-taking strategy I currently used takes outlining for the most part with some of the list method. But as noted in College Success (2015), it isn't very efficient for retaining information, and it would be best to use other techniques instead. I have also employed the listing technique in my notes as well, and as reported in our textbook it isn't very effective for retaining information. When I use it, I'll often have to restructure and rewrite some of the material in order to remember it since it is quite easy to let your mind drift while copying or listing material. I don't find that my current strategy for taking notes is very helpful and change could benefit my studies greatly. So I will try to explore a way(s) I can quickly take notes, while employing my own thoughts on the material as well.
