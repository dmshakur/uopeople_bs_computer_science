## Part 1:

Taking ownership of your own learning means deciding how you learn. It is being disciplined enough to deciding when to learn and with what tools. It is recognizing the effectiveness of learning methods, both to the learner personally and they're broader intentions. For example, knowing what learning strategies work for you and which don't. If you look at Edgar Dale's cones of learning (1946) you will see that knowledge retention rates significantly go up with active learning. According to Poly Technic (n.d.), active learning is just "activities" that promote "you to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information". A passive learning technique like reading is quite ineffective according to the cone diagram, where the retention rate is merely 10%. Although, you can employ active learning techniques into reading such as note-taking to increase its effectiveness. While active learning is more like an "activity" passive learning is more of something that happens in the background, more an exercise in observation than interaction.

## Part 2:
According to Page and Vincent (n.d.), the role of an online instructor is to, design, facilitate, and direct. Designing a course itself is necessary as a part of planning the classes education, and is where one should start a course. The instructor does so by finding appropriate materials for their students at a proper level of difficulty. Being a designer is like being an architect if you don't design a building, how will anyone know what to build? The design of the course could also be thought of as the initial plan or framework of the course. Upon beginning the course the last responsibilities of an instructor come to bear facilitation and direction. Facilitation is what someone can do to set the tone for an environment. When they curate certain assignments so that we will learn skills deemed important by the instructor. Instructors can also implement educational strategies that will help students learn skills that will promote our academic and professional future. Last but not least direction. Direction is a tome when a student needs help or guidance with understanding the course material, or when they've come across a situation that is an outlier to what is normally expected. This is where instructors have the opportunity to clarify and help students better understand details in coursework or in the student's expectations.

## Part 3:
Peer assessment is a component of online learning (and elsewhere) that helps promote our ability to think and assess, an important skill necessary for true success. Another benefit of peer assessment is the opportunity to glimpse through the eyes of our instructors and practice analyzing others work. Being able to analyze other people's work is important for many careers, and essential for leadership roles, like the manager of a restaurant. Peer assessment teaches us to be thorough and review others' work, while still being thoughtful and respectful of their humanity and skill level. Doing a writing assignment for example an teach us about a subject, but peer assessment is recognizing errors in someone's work and correcting them. To do this we must ensure that we have a solid understanding of the subject and are able to give sound advice, praise, and criticisms.
