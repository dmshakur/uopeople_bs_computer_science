Part 2
A. The Exponential distribution is frequently used to model times between events (Yakir, 2011). 

B. The exponential distribution could be best used in a situation where time is the space you are trying to determine whether or not an event has occurred, such as whether or not your cat has returned home, like an outdoor cat.

C. The Binomial random variable is used in settings in which a trial that has two possible outcomes is repeated several times (Yakir, 2011).

D. To me what the binomial random variable sound like is basically a binary classification problem, where the result is the probable accuracy of x in n trials. So a binomial could be used in machine learning where binary classification is necessary or any other time when we have a binary outcome with multiple events, like whether or not college students got accepted into a college that they applied to.

## Part 3
A. The function pbinom is for calculating the cumulative relative frequency of the q values. What's happening is that the event q has a 1/6 chance of occurring, and we calculate the probability that an event will occur if we have n trials, which is what the size parameter represents. The output of the code in question is the number, 0.9975618, which means that the probability of the event occurring either 5 or fewer times is 99.75%.

#### B. 
The second code block is the same as far as operations go. The input parameters are the only thing that is different. This is similar to the examples in our textbook, Introduction to Statistical Thinking (Yakir, 2011), on several occasions. The value 0.5 represents the probability that an event will occur x times or 9 times in this case, and since we are getting the cumulative relative frequency the output is the probability that we will draw a 9 or 8 or 7, all the way down to 0. Output:  0.9990234.

#### C. 
The third and final code snippet in question is dealing with the cumulative relative frequency for the uniform distribution, but instead of getting the probability of an event occurring, we are getting the probability that an event occurs in a range of 4-5. Where the second and third parameters represent the range that you trying to find the probability that an event will occur, which is the first parameter, values 4 and 5. The concept here is the same as the equation for the IQR, where we are just trying to find the range of something, but with the function punif, we are also finding the cumulative relative frequency.
