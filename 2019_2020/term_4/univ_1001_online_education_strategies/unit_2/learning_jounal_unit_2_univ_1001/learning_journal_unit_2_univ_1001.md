General comment:


Overall the ideas and motivations that drive Amnesty International are delivered to the reader in this paper. But I will say that the level of detail could have been greater and more attention could have been paid to the flow of the document. You answered the right questions and detailed what they do and where while fulfilling most of your requirements. At times your paper feels very abrupt but it does not suffer the message. Next time I hope you do more proofreading and let the paper tell its story without unnecessary restriction.
