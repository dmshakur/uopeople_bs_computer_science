## Section 4.4: Got notes?
### Learning objectives
* Explain why taking notes is important
* Use the four primary methods of note taking: lists, outlines, concept maps, and the cornell method.
* Define which methods support your learning style and the instructor's teaching style.
* Apply strategies to make note taking more effective.
* Use some effective strategies if you happen to miss a class.
* Organize your notes into effective study guides.
* Use teacher handouts to complement your notes.
* Determine what to do with your notes after the course is complete.

### Note taking methods:
* Lists:
    * Description:
        * A sequential list of ideas present in the material/lecture. They can be short phrases or paragraphs going into detail.
    * When to Use:
        * As a fallback if they are not familiar with other methods. Can require a lot of writing and be difficult to keep up with the lecture.
* Outlines:
    * Description:
        * The most important ideas are placed on the left margin and supporting ideas come indented with capital letters.
    * When to Use:
        * Good for well organized material being presented by a professor.
* Concept maps:
    * Description:
        * A central idea is places in the center of the page with lines going to circles with supporting ideas.
    * When to Use:
        * Great for showing relationships.
* Cornell method:
    * Description:
        * A 2 column approach. The left column is referred to as the cue or recall column. The right column is for taking notes using the above methods, or a mixture of them. After the lecture review the notes and write down key concepts and ideas.
    * When to Use:
        * Good for prioritizing ideas and organizing review work.
#### List method:
Using the list method doesn't focus on processing information as much as the other methods. Therefore if the list method is used it is recommended to transcribe them to another method that will require the mind to readapt it to a compressed format, instead of just regurgitating the information.

#### Outline method:
Priority is the key here. Main ideas go in the left margin and all subsequent ideas are indented to the right, recursing as necessary. It is helpful to determine what information is presented before hand.

#### Concept maps:
Very similar to a decision tree. An broad subject/idea is stated in the center and branches off with arrow or line to other subsequent ideas and their own details.

#### Cornell method:
The Cornell method is useful for its flexibility. It has four components a header, footer and two columns. The header is the title and the footer is the summary. The left column is for the bigger ideas that you base off of what you write in the right column, which is where most of the note taking takes place.

When you write notes try to make connections with other classes. Try to think about what you are writing instead of having it just be a mindless exercise. 

Never use handouts like powerpoint slides as a substitute for notes as they do not involve you in the learning process.

### General note taking tips:
Be prepared. Write on only one side of the paper. Label, number and data all notes at the top of the page. When using a laptop, position it as such that you can see the instructor and white board right over your screen. Don't try to capture everything that is said. Copy anything the instructor writes on the board. Leave space between ideas. Use signals and abbreviations. Use some method for identifying your own thoughts and questions to keep them separate from what the instructor or textbook is saying. Create a symbol to use when you fall behind. Review your notes as soon after class as possible (the same day is best). Write a summary of the main ideas of the class in your own words.
