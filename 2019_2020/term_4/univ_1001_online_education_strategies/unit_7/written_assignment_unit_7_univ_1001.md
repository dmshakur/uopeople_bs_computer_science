As you read about in the textbook this week, goal-setting is an important strategy to manage your time and stay on track with your education. Reflect on the importance of goal-setting, and answer the following questions:

1. Briefly, share a time when you set a goal and did not accomplish it, and then share a time when you set a goal and successfully achieved it. Why werenâ€™t you successful in your first example? Why were you successful in your second example? 

2. Why does effective goal-setting help us achieve goals? What are the characteristics of good goals?

3. Based on your answer to questions 1 and 2, set three goals: one short-term, one mid-term, and one long-term.
