## Part 2
#### A:
The length function is something that I've been familiar with for years. Generally when we think of the mathematical term $n$, we are talking about the number of items in a vector or some other kind of list/array. Basically length is just that, $n$. Although, in a lot of programming languages getting the length of something like a list of lists will not necessarily get you the amount of elements inside, it will only get you the amount of elements that are in the first "layer", or the most immediate items. For example if you had a vector with a vector inside it, if you got the length of the outer vector, you would get $n=1$, regardless of how many elements are in the inner vector.

#### B:
According to Statistical Inference (p. 38, 2011) variance is 'the average of the squares of the deviations'. I believe that the reason why we square these value(s) is so that we can get a non-negative integer, because when we have a non-negative integer we can more easily compare it to results from different data sources if we want. There are other statistical measurements that utilize such an approach as well.

## Part 3
I don't think that I will have too much trouble putting aside extra time for the difficulty increase. Up til now, I've been able to finish all my work within a few hours (4 maybe, give or take 2 hours at the most), where taking notes on our text book takes up the most time.
