## The sampling distribution

### 7.1: Student learning objective
The sampling distribution corresponds to all samples that could have been selected. Summaries of the distribution of the data such as the mean and the standard deviation become random variables in the context of the sampling distribition.

What I need to be able to do to ensure that I have properly absorbed the material.
* Comprehend the notion of sampling distribution and simulate the sampling distribution of the sample average.
* Relate the expectation and standard deviation of a measurement to the expectation and standard deviation of the sample average.
* Apply the central limit theorem to the sample averages.

### 7.2: The sampling distribution
A random variable ceases to be a random variable when we take a sample, then it becomes an observed value.

### 7.3: A random sample
A relationship between the sample and the data is similar to the relation between a random variable and the observed value. The collection of all possible evaluations of the sample is the sample space of the random sample and the probabilities of the different evalutuations of the sample is the sample space of the random sample and the probabilities of the different evalutuations produce the distribution of the random sample. 

A statistic is the function of a data set. In each case of a different statistic like the mean, a formula is applied to the data.

The same formula tha is applied to the observed data may, in principle, be applied to random samples. Hence, for example, one may talk of the sample average, which is the average of the elements in the data. If we think of the average in terms of a random sample then it becomes a random variable. 

The role of statistics is to make inference on the parameters of the unobserved population based on the information that is obtained from the sample.

Often when we get the sample mean it is often close to the population mean. In real settings you most likely won't have access to the real popultation parameters. Still you would want to have some kind of estimate that summarize your data.
