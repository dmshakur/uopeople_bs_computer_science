#### Tested at every turn
Many of the things we do in our daily lives are a way to measure our skill level and mastery of a subject, these are things we often enjoy.

### 6.1 Test anxiety and how to control it
Anxiety can be a good thing and can serve as a motivator, in moderation. In large amounts anxiety can impede your ability to work, study or take tests. 
* Being prepared and having all relevant knowledge readily accessible in your mind is vital to completing a test successfully, and not doing so could cause stress.
* Keeping negative thoughts away, as they will only help propagate, negativity.
* Visualization of success.
* Focus on yourself and not others.
* Create a plan for the exam.
* Sleep well and eat well before the exam.
* Do not get too worked up, relaxation lets the mind think more clearly.

### 6.2 Studying to learn (not just for tests)
Learning is when you have information stored in your brain and you are able to readily recall it and use it. 

#### Studying every day
The best time to study is after your class when the knowledge is still fresh. The first step in any study session should be to gather your materials. Before you start to study use a thought exercise to determine your goal for the material and try to find how it will apply to your life. 

#### Studying in course units
When you complete a section of a course (2 weeks for example) write yourself a summarization of the material so that it better cements itself in your mind.

#### Studying before the exam
Put yourself in the instructors shoes and think about what kind of questions s/he would ask and what they would expect or want you to know.

#### More tips for success
Rigorously follow a study schedule in a place that is not disruptive, minimize distractions and take breaks every hour.

#### Studying in groups
Studying in a group can be a great way to get new perspective on material and notes, but it can also be hindered by general conversation, if left unchecked.
* A very large study group can lead to issues, so stick to a small number, 3 or 4.
* Study time is about learning, pick people who are doing well in the course.
* Adding students to your learning group that have learning styles or other attributes that complement you own will be extremely helpful.
* Meet regularly as non participation can lead to the groups collapse.
* Have a moderator to make sure the group stays on track and develop an agenda or plan for the group.
    * Agenda example
        * Review class and assignment notes
        * Discuss reading material
        * Quiz each other on material
        * Reteach each other aspects of the material
        * Brainstorm possible test questions and responses
        * Review quiz and test results and correct misunderstandings
        * Critique each others ideas for paper themes and approaches
        * Define questions to ask the instructor
* Assign work for following up on what was studied together.
* Rotate the moderator role.

### 6.3 Taking tests

#### Types of tests
There are two different kinds of tests, formative assessments and summative assessments. Formative assessments include quizzes and unit tests and thus are not typically anything more than recall of information. While summative assessments on the other hand are typically more creative assignments, like written papers. While a pop quiz or some smaller test may not affect your grade as much as a paper, they will notify you of what you need to improve on in the course going forward, and thus will affect 

* Paper tests, and while they do not apply to me, neatness and grammar matter.
* When taking an open book tests make sure that you are using the material correctly, it won't look great if you are taking a test and have all your notes and textbooks available and can't get the material right.
* Take home tests are similar to open book tests, except you have much more time to do them.
* When taking an online test be wary that you will have a much smaller room for error, as only the strictly correct answer will be considered. Don't wait until the last minute to take the test.
* When conducting presentations or oral tests, stay aware of your time frame so that you aren't cut off at the end of your presentation.

#### Tips for taking tests
* Learn all you can about the test and what material will likely be on it.
* Try to predict what material is going to be on the test so you can study more specifically for it.
* Don't cram studying. Get exercise and watch what you eat.
* Be early, and follow directions carefully.
* Create a plan for the test.
* It will be harder to remember certain things as the test goes on so write down any important information such as equations.
* Make sure you have a very clear understanding of the questions.
* Do the easy questions first. This will give you more time to think about the tough stuff.
* Keep an eye on the clock and make sure that you make good use of your time.
* Check your answers to make sure that they are correct.

#### Strategies for math and science exams
##### Do the following before a test
* Keep careful notes on what you do wrong.
* Think about how a problem can be applied to a real life situation.
* In a study group take turns presenting solutions
* Get help for with concepts that you don't understand

##### Do the following during a test
* Review everything prior to solving the problems
* Approach each problem with 3 distinct steps
    1. Read through the problem and ask yourself questions like, what is this about, what facts do you have available, or what are the variables or measurable units.
    2. Compute the answer and eliminate as many unknowns as possible.
    3. Review and check your answers.
* Review your note prior to the test.
* Read the question carefully and think about what the instructor expects
* Look carefully at the diagrams
* Many scientific questions are based on the scientific method, when reading a question  identify the hypothesis.

### 6.4 The secrets of the Q and A's
You will gain more confidence in test taking when you understand the different kinds of questions.

#### Multiple questions
* There may be more than one right answer, check if they expect you to chose just one or more than one.
* Try to answer the question before looking at the available answers.
* Less absolute words are often found in the correct option.
* Carefully read the question it is easy to miss a word if read to quickly that could result in the question having a very different meaning.

#### True-or-false questions
* Be particularly aware of absolute words as they can determine the correct answer.
* Answer the obvious questions first, then focus on the ones that require more thought.
* If a question is put in a positive light reframe the question to become negative, does the new statement sound more true or false?
* If you are unsure select true as more true answers are often in a test.

#### Matching column
* Start by looking at the two columns to be matched. Is there an equal number of items in both? If they aren't equal do you have to match items in the shorter to two or more items in the longer, or can you leave some unmatched?
* Does one column have a series of single words to be matched to phrases on the other columns, read the phrases first, then all the single words before trying to make any matches. Now go back and read each phrase and find the word that best suits the phrase.
* If both columns have single words to be matched, look to cut down the number of potential matches by grouping them by parts of speech.
* As always, start by making the matches that are obvious to you, and then work on the ones that require more thought. Mark off all items you have already used so you an easily see which words or phrases still remain to be matched.

#### Short answer questions
Short answer questions are designed to target specific information and concepts.

#### Essay questions
* Essay questions can target your thinking and reasoning skills applied to the course material.
* Careful planning is critical to answering theses questions effectively.
* Highlight keywords in the questions, and read it carefully.
* If you have time organize your thoughts into a quick outline.
* Introduce the answer to your essay but get straight to the point.
* Your instructor will be reading a great deal of essays so be sure to avoid pointless filler content, and get straight to the point.
* Make sure that you spelling, structure and grammar are on point.
* Be sure to answer all parts of the question.

#### 6.5 The honest truth
Grades are not the be all end all of an education. People often rationalize dishonesty as a result, don't do that, that is what weak people do.
* If you cheat you won't learn much, and if you ever have to use it in your career then you will find out that you are less capable if you are at all.
* You risk failing a class or being expelled.
* It can cause stress.
* You are wasting your time if you do.
* You are trashing your integrity.
* It lowers yourself esteem.

Technology has made it easier to cheat. Be careful not to do so.

The following acts could be academic dishonesty:
1. Cheating.
2. Plagiarism.
3. Fabrication.
4. Obtaining an unfair advantage, i.e. stealing the answers to the test you are taking.
5. Aiding and abetting academic dishonesty.
6. Falsification of records and official documents.
7. Unauthorized access, i.e. modifying results of tests after submitting.

### 6.6 Using test results
After having completed the test it is your job to then look it over and find out what you did wrong so you can improve. Listen to the instructor when they give you back the test.

#### Evaluating your test results
Find out what you did wrong and why you made mistakes, then use that information to study in a way that mitigates these problems.

#### Correcting your mistakes
* For multiple-choice questions, write out the question stem with the correct answer to form a single correct sentence or phrase.
* For true/false, rewords the statement to either be true or false.
* For math and science, redo the calculations fully.
* For an essay, create a new and better outline that you think would've done better.
* Read your answers out loud after rewriting them.
