### How to Use Brainstorming Questions to Evaluate Ideas
When leaping into brainstorming, design, and production, it's probably a good idea to ask a few questions to clarify the vision behind the new solution.

Starbursting comes in when random questions lead to random answers, that are a chaotic mass of information unlikely to inform decision making or help clarify the projects vision, purpose, and process.

### What is starbursting
Starbursting is a twist on brainstorming that encourages team members to start creative juices flowing by asking questions rather than providing instant answers.

Starbursting starts with a star as a diagram, with each point in the star labeled with: who, what, where, why, when, and how. As many as 50 questions can be generated, once finished they need to be answered.

Starbursting can also be used to explore possibilities, philosophical directions or ideas. You can explore any concept in the star and start generating ideas.

#### Starbursting pros and cons
* Great technique for exploring an idea.
* Easy to generate focused questions that deserve answers.
* Generate questions that may not come up otherwise.
* Not intended as a tool for planning.

### How to starburst
1. Draw the star.
2. In the center of the star goes the topic, issue, product, idea or concept.
3. Write a one word question on each start point: who, what, when, where, why and how.
4. Brainstorm questions that start with each word in each star point.
5. Brainstorm questions until you have enough to facilitate a discussion, the article recommends 3.
6. Systematically answer the questions, and write down short versions of each question next to their respective point.

#### Managing questions
Keep on task and focused without devolving into long winded discussions for individual questions early on.

Be careful when asking questions that could potentially derail the discussion.

If non-relevant questions come up they can be added to another list to be tackled at a different time.

#### Managing people
Starbursting can be a time when people that like to hear their own voices try and dominate the discussion.

Techniques to mitigate such issues include:
* Using a timer.
* Call on anyone that hasn't yet spoken.
* Go around the room as you go around the star.
* Have everyone write their own questions down then collect them.
* Have two separate meetings for asking and answering.

#### Managing time
Starbursting can take a lot of time. The challenge is to make sure that every question is answered.

Strategies for managing time:
* Limit time available for each portion of the process. Five minutes per question, three minutes for addressing each question, etc.
* Limit the number of questions for each star.
* Create a group for each point in the star.
* Post the chart in a common space for everyone to see and write questions on.

### Variations on starbursting
Instagram used a similar technique for identifying the major issues with mobile photography.

They brain storm a set of questions to consider then select three to focus on. After lengthy discussion they were able to pinpoint the three most significant issues related to mobile photography at the time, lackluster photos, long upload times, and share-ability.

They then developed a set of actionable corporate statements.
1. Vision: We want all of our user's photos to upload to our app seamlessly, looking exceptionally beautiful, where they can all comment and share without any distractions.
2. Issue statement: Today, too many apps capture poor photos that miss the photographers vision. It takes too long to upload photos via text message, making it difficult to share.
3. Method: Discover the final needs of users with a human-centered design process. Lean methods will help up constantly improve our product.

The end of this story is, of course, common knowledge. Instagram was able to build one of the world’s foremost mobile photography sharing sites and apps in the world, demonstrating how powerful a process of deeper questioning can be.

### Summarization
* Starbursting is a form of brainstorming that focuses on questions before answers.
* It is conducted with the use of a six sided star, each point is assigned one question.
* Participants generate questions starting with each point's word.
* Multiple questions are generated for each point.
* Questions are addressed by the group.
* It is more complex than it seems and should be managed by a facilitator.
* It's a good way to generate and consider ideas, but not a solution for creating a plan of action.

(n.d.)

If you only fix the symptoms of an issue, what you see on the surface, the underlying problem will almost certainly return and need fixing over and over again. However if you look deeper to figure out what's causing the problem, you can fix the underlying systems and processes so that it goes away for good.

Root cause analysis, is a often used technique to answering why a problem occurred in the first place. It uses a specific set of tools to identify the origin of a problem.
1. Determine what happened.
2. Determine why it happened.
3. Figure out what to do to reduce the likelihood that it will happen again.

RCA assumes that systems and events are interrelated. An action in one area triggers an action in another. By tracing backwards through actions, you can discover where it started and how it grew into the issue your facing.

There are three basic types of causes.
1. Physical: Tangible, material items failed in some way.
2. Human causes: People did something wrong, or did not do something that was needed. Human causes typically lead to physical causes.
3. Organizational causes: A system, process or policy that people use to make decisions or do their work is faulty. i.e. People making assumptions that something is being done by someone else when it is in fact not.

RCA involves investigating the patterns of negative effects, finding hidden flaws in the system, and discovering specific actions that contributed to the problem. RCA can reveal more than one root cause.

> Use good judgement and common sense to determine how far back into previous actions you should go into determining a problem. You can trace an issue as far back into history if you want, but that will likely serve no purpose

### The root cause analysis process
1. Define the problem:
    * What do you see happening?
    * What are the specific symptoms?

2. Collect data:
    * What proof do you have that the problem exists?
    * How long has the problem existed?
    * What is the impact of the problem?

A full analysis is necessary to understand the situation fully. Include any and all parties involved who understand the situation. People who are most familiar with the problem can help lead you to a better understanding of the issues. 

CATWOE is a helpful tool for this process which helps look at different perspectives.
* C: Customers
* A: Actors, who implement the solutions
* T: Transformation, the process that is affected
* W: World view
* O: Owner, of the process
* E: Environmental constraints

3. Identify possible causal factors:
    * What sequence of events leads to the problem?
    * What conditions allow the problem to occur?
    * What other problems surround the occurrence of the central problem?
During this stage identify as many causal factors as possible. People often identify only a few factors and then stop, this is not sufficient. You want to dig deeper than simply treating the most obvious cases.

Tools for determining causal factors:
* Use the facts and ask "So what?" to determine all possible consequences of a fact.
* Ask "Why?" until you get to the root of the problem.
* Break down a problem into small, detailed parts to better understand the big picture.
* Cause and effect diagrams: Create a chart of all the possible causal factors, to see where the trouble may have begun.

4. Identify the root cause(s):
    * Why does the casual factor exist?
    * What is the real reason the problem occurred?
Use the tools to identify causal factors to look at the roots of each factor.

5. Recommend and implement solutions:
    * What can you do to prevent the problem from happening again?
    * How will the solution be implemented?
    * Who will be responsible for it?
    * What are the risks of implementing the solution?

Analyze your process, plan ahead to predict the effects of your solution.

### Key points
Figure out what negative events are occurring. Then look at the complex systems around these problems and identify key points of failure. Finally, determine solutions to address those key points, or root causes.

RCA is an essential tool for performing comprehensive, system wide review of significant problems as well as the events and factors that lead to them.

## The ladder of inference

### Release time
(n.d.)

Our understanding of something is dependent upon the situation and ourselves. This varies widely. People will interpret events and situations differently and pay attention to different aspects of what is happening. The ladder of inference is a model of the steps used to make sense of situations in order to act. It helps with meta-cognition and with coordinating our thoughts with other people.

### Available data:
All directly observable data, such as speech, tone of voice, body movement, reports statistical surveys etc.

#### Example:
Karen responds to your suggestion by pausing a moment and then saying, "That sounds like a rational approach."

### Select data:
We can't pay attention to everything so we make conscious choices about what data to use and what to ignore. This process usually occurs subconsciously.

#### Example:
You say to yourself, "Karen is saying that there is a problem with my suggestion. While it is rational, it does not address the emotions involved."

### Name what is happening:
This continues the interpretation process by classifying what is happening into a more general category.

#### Example:
You characterize Karen's actions as "Having doubts about my suggestion and covering them up."

### Explain or evaluate what is happening:
Draw on a stock of causal theories to explain why what happened is. And/or evaluate is by drawing on our value system to determine a positive or negative state.

#### Example:
You make the assessment that "Karen is uncomfortable with conflict and is politely preventing us from being of more help to her.

### Decide what to do:
We use our repertoire fo actions to decide what to do based on our explanations or evaluations of what is happening.

#### Example:
You decide to stop offering suggestions.

### Reflexive loop:
Our assumptions, values, and beliefs influence how we select data, interpret what is happening, and decide what to do. 

Our interpretations and decisions then feedback to reinforce (usually) our assumptions, values, and beliefs. 

We act on the basis of our interpretations, and our actions affect what data is available to us. 

Our ways of understanding and acting in the world create a self-reinforcing system, insulating us from alternative ways of understanding.

### Using the ladder:

#### The impacts of jumping up the ladder
* Our own conclusions seem obviously right to us.
* People can and do reach different conclusions. When they each view their own conclusions as obvious, they don't see a need to say how they reached them.
* People see different conclusions of others as obviously wrong, and invent reasons to explain why others say things that are so obviously wrong.
* When People disagree, they often hurl conclusions at each other from the top of their respective ladders.

#### General guidelines
* Notice your conclusions as conclusions based on your inferences, not as self-evident facts.
* Assume your reasoning process could have gaps or errors that you do not see.
* Use examples to illustrate the data you select that led to you conclusions.
* Paraphrase (out loud) the meanings you hear in what others say, so that you can check if you are understanding correctly.
* Explain the steps in your thinking that takes you from the data you select and the meanings you paraphrase to the conclusions you reach.
Ask others if they have other ways of interpreting the data or if they see gaps in your thinking.
* Assume that others may reach different conclusions because they have their own ladder of inference with a logic that makes sense to them.
* Ask others to illustrate the data they select and the meanings they paraphrase.
* Ask others to explain the steps in their thinking.

### What is critical thinking?
In short critical thinking is more than understanding something - it involves evaluation, critiquing, and a depth of knowledge that surpasses the subject itself and expands outward. It requires problem-solving, creativity, rationalization, and a refusal to accept things at face value.

It's a willingness and ability to question everything.

#### Where do you want to go?
Think about how you answered the questions above. Be honest with yourself. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent), how would you rate your level of thinking skills at this time.

The three most important areas in which I think I can improve:
* Analyzing information.
* Thinking critically.
* Asking questions about information.

#### It's all in your head.
College life is different from high school there are different pressures involved. The two most fundamental differences involve expectations - the expectation that you'll be independent, taking responsibility for your actions and having to think for yourself.

Thinking in high school is very structured and tied closely with what is taught in class, where students typically memorize information. (This seems like a very poor model)

Higher order thinking skills while hardly used in high school are necessary for real success in college. Your success in college and in life is ultimately tied to being a better and more complete thinker, utilizing critical and creative thinking skills. These skills require consistent practice to master.

### 3.1 Types of thinking
#### Learning Objectives:
* Understanding that there are different types of thinking.
* Identify how each type of thinking contributes to learning.

Benjamin Bloom developed a classification of thinking skills that are still useful today, known as Bloom's taxonomy. There are six ranked in order of knowledge, complexity, comprehension, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. 

#### Thinking skills and what they involve:
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * Retrieving or repeating information or ideas from memory. This is the first and most basic thinking skill you develop.
2. Understanding:
    * Interpreting, constructing meaning, inferring, or explaining material from written, spoken, or graphic sources. Reading is the most common understanding, these skills are developed starting with early education.
3. Applying:
    * Using learned material or implementing material in new situations. This skill is commonly used starting in middle school.
4. Analyzing:
    * Breaking material or concepts into key elements and determining how the parts relate to one another or to an overall structure or purpose. Mental actions included in this skill are examining, contrasting or differentiating, separating, categorizing, experimenting or deducing. You most likely started developing this skill in high school and will continue to practice it in college.
5. Evaluating:
    * *Assessing*, *making judgments*, and *drawing conclusions* from ideas, information, or data. *Critiquing* the value and usefulness of material. This skill encompasses most of what is commonly referred to as critical thinking, this skill will be called on frequently during your college years and beyond. Critical thinking is the first focus of this chapter.
6. Creating:
    * *Putting parts together* or *reorganizing* them in a new way, form, or product. This process is the most difficult mental function. This skill will make you stand out in college and is in very high demand in the workforce. Creative thinking is the second focus of this chapter.

All of these skills are important for college work and real world applications. The mid-level skills will be practiced a lot in college. While the higher thinking skills are the most demanding, and you will need to invest focused effort to develop them.

#### Exercise: thought inventory
Identify in the past weeks of school work where and how you used the previously listed thinking skills.
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * I'm actually not very good at this one. I often go to do something and forget what it is I set out to do.
2. Understanding:
    * A very important skill, I utilize different kinds of note taking to cement information followed by using it to further understand.
3. Applying:
    * Similar to the Understanding section, in order to understand things like machine learning and deep learning libraries, I simply use them and apply the knowledge. Trying things out increases ability on a subject.
4. Analyzing:
    * I use this whenever I debug code I write. I will write a program or script, get an error message and have to work my way through the code and find what went wrong and how to fix it. I also use this skill when working with data and how best to process it and use it to achieve the goal of making accurate predictions.
5. Evaluating (evaluating):
    * I do this when the best course of action in my life and education. Which requires a great deal of effort and thought, as there are many possible roads and combinations of paths that can be taken. One must ensure that the right paths are taken, with the right amount of time and effort spent on each.
6. Creating:
    * I don't use this as much. I will use it however when writing code, such as when I wrote a C++ program of a neural network. I had to identify how to use my knowledge on neural networks and create one that could process data and come out with a prediction that was useful.

#### Verbs signifying the use of specific critical thinking skills
1. Remembering and recalling:
    * Bookmark, count, describe, draw, enumerate, find, google, identify, label, list, match, name, quote, recall, recite,search, select, sequence, tell, write
2. Understanding:
    * Blog, conclude, describe, discuss, explain, generalize, identify, illustrate, interpret, paraphrase, predict, report,restate, review, summarize, tell, tweet
3. Applying:
    * Apply, articulate, change, chart, choose, collect, compute, control, demonstrate, determine, do, download,dramatize, imitate, implement, interview, install (as in software), participate, prepare, produce, provide, report,role-play, run (software), select, share, show, solve, transfer, use
4. Analyzing:
    * Analyze, break down, characterize, classify, compare, contrast, debate, deduce, diagram, differentiate,discriminate, distinguish, examine, infer, link, outline, relate, research, reverse-engineer, separate, subdivide, tag
5. Evaluating (evaluating):
    * Appraise, argue, assess, beta test, choose, collaborate, compare, contrast, conclude, critique, criticize, decide, defend, “friend/de-friend,” evaluate, judge, justify, network, post, predict, prioritize, prove, rank, rate, review, select, support
6. Creating:
    * Adapt, animate, blog, combine, compose, construct, create, design, develop, devise, film, formulate, integrate, invent, make, model, modify, organize, perform, plan, podcast, produce, program, propose, rearrange, remix, revise, rewrite, structure

Preparing for class requires you to analyze what you know and what you need to learn. 

### 3.2 It's critical
In todays environment where there is a wealth of information at our fingertips, it isn't too critical to know a great deal of information. The challenge is often filtering it with critical thinking skills.

Critical thinking is the ability to discover an idea, a set of beliefs, a claim, or an argument.It requires logic and reasoning to evaluate information to make a decision or reach a conclusion.

Critical thinking is:
* A foundation for effective communication.
* The principal skill used in effective decision making.
* At the core of creating new knowledge.
* A way to uncover bias and prejudices.

#### The critical thinking process
Critical thinking is nothing more than asking the right questions to understand a problem and gathering data to make a decision on a problem.

Understanding what problem or issue you are really considering is important. Often times we will take up a side on something without realizing that it's not the issue we care about but some other secondary effect accomplishing dominance can have.

Being able to identify different options and view points is important for critical thinking. Doing so will enable you to examine possible outcomes and see which decision could be the best for you. Thinking about the consequences of each is also important. Make sure that you have all the information for each option, and get it if you don't. Keep an open mind and don't dismiss supporting information on any position until you evaluate it carefully.

Determine how good your information is. Be on the lookout for bias, fallacies and logical errors in your thinking and evidence. Learn to identify you own weaknesses in thinking.

#### Fallacies
1. Generalizations:
    * Description: Making assumptions about a whole group of people on an inadequate sample.
    * Example 1: Engineering students are nerds.
    * Example 2: My economics class is boring, and my friend says her economic class is boring too - therefore all economics classes are boring.
    * How to avoid it in your own thinking: What kind of sample are you using? Is it large enough to support the conclusions by using the word "some" or "many".
2. False cause:
    * Description: Drawing improper conclusions through sequencing. If A comes before B, then A causes B.
    * Example: I studied biology last term, and this term I'm taking organic chem, which is very confusing. Biology makes chemistry confusing.
    * How to avoid: When making casual statements, be sure you can explain the process through which A causes B beyond their mere sequences.
3. Personalizations:
    * Description: Also known by their latin names (ad hominem, or "against the man" and tu quoque, or "you too"). Inserting personalities inappropriately. Into an argument. Common political arguments.
    * Example: Against the man: I won't support senator smith's education bill. He's had a mistress and marital problems.
    * Description: How to avoid: Focus on the merits and supporting data of an argument, not on the personality or behavior of the people making the arguments.
4. Everyone does it:
    * Also known by its latin name (ad populum, or "against many"). Justifying an issue based solely on the number of people involved.
    * Example 1: You too: A parent explains the evidence of risks of binge drinking. The child rejects the arguments saying, "When you were my age, you drank too".
    * Example 2: It's healthy to drink only soda, millions of American kids do.
    * How to avoid: The popular position is not always the right one. Be wary of arguments that rely exclusively on one set of numbers.
5. Appealing to authority:
    * Description: Using an endorsement from someone as a primary reason for supporting a point of view.
    * Example 1: We should oppose higher taxes, curt shilling does.
    * Example 2: Pitcher curt shilling may be credible authority on baseball, but is he an authority on taxes.
    * How to avoid: Quoting authorities is a valuable tool to build an argument, make sure the authorities you quote are truly subject matter experts on the issue you are discussing.
6. Weak analogy:
    * Description: Using irrelevant similarities in two object to draw a conclusion.
    * Example: Cars and motorcycles are both driven at high speeds on the highway. Car drivers aren't required to wear helmets, so motorcycle riders shouldn't have to either.
    * How to avoid: You can draw an analogy between just about any two objects or ideas. If you are using an analogy, make sure you identify the properties. (In the example, the motorcycle does not provide protection to the rider, but the car does. Equating the two vehicles based on traveling speed is not relevant to the argument).
7. False dichotomy:
    * Description: Setting up a situation in which it looks like there are only two possible options. If one option is discredited, the other must be accepted.
    * Example: The classic example here is "America, love it or leave it".
    * How to avoid: Examine your own thinking. Are there really only two options? LOok for the third option. If you were asked to develop a compromise between the two positions, what would it look like? What would the strengths and weaknesses be?

Common critical thinking situations
* Personal choices.
* Reading, listening, note taking, studying.
* Research papers.
* Essay questions on exams.

#### Tips for critical thinking
* Consider all points of view, considering more than two and looking for grey areas.
* Keep an open mind.
* Answer three questions about your supporting:
    1. Is it enough support?
    2. Is it the right support?
    3. Is it credible?
* Look for evidence that contradicts your view point. Pretend to disagree with it. What parts of your argument are weak. Do you have supporting facts to overcome that evidence?
* Create a set of criteria to evaluate the strength of information you wan to use to support your argument. Ask questions like these.
* List your main points and the evidence you have to support it.
* Make sure your opinions are supported by facts and not opinions.
* Writers will often rely on certain types of arguments, so be on the look out for fallacies you use habitually.
* Be careful with broad generalizations and absolute words.

Determine where your information came from and whether or not it is a credible source.

Critical thinking is evaluating the strengths of your arguments, data, and information.

### 3.3 Searching for "Aha!"
Learning objectives
1. Use creative thinking
2. Understand the difference between creative thinking and free-form thinking.
3. Practice guidelines for creating ideas.
4. Use rules and directions to create effectively.
5. Understand group creativity.

Creative thinking is the ability to look at things from a new perspective, and come up with new solutions.

#### Tips for Creative thinking
* Feed your curiosity.
    * Creativity is often about rearranging known ideas as it is about creating a completely known concept.
* Develop your flexibility.
    * There is often more than one right answer, don't think that theres only one.
* Combine old ideas in new ways.
    * Think outside the box train yourself to think, think what is the most ridiculous solution I can come up with. Or how would you solve a problem when transported to a time such as the 1930s.
* Think metaphorically.
    * Thinking with metaphors takes practice. Observe how metaphors are used throughout communication and think about why those metaphors are effective.
* Ask.
    * A creative thinker always questions the way things are. Get in the habit of asking questions, lots of questions.

#### Key takeaways
* Creative thinking is a requirement for success.
* Creative thinkings is a deliberate process that can be learned and practiced.
* Important virtues of a creative person:
    * Curiosity.
    * Flexibility.
    * Looking for more than one right answer.
    * Combining things in new ways.
    * Thinking metaphorically.
    * Questioning the way things are.

#### A metaphor for life (exercise)
Life is like an ultra marathon, it starts out fun, but the rest is filled with pain and suffering and with moments of fun and joy here and there.
#### What if we had eyes on the back of our heads
It would change everything. Wars would be fought differently, the element of surprise would be significantly hampered if we had such a large cone (or cones) of vision. In general it would probably be much harder to get the jump on anyone. Out brains would probably be under a lot more stress from all the extra input and be bigger. We would wear out hair differently, bald would be common for sure.

### 3.4 Problem solving and decision making
Learning objectives
1. Learn to understand the problem
2. Learn to combine thinking and critical thinking to solve problems
3. Practice problem solving in a group

Most of your college life will be spent solving problems, which require time and effort in order to come up with a solution. There are a few basic steps you can take to find the solution.
1. Define the problem:
    * Use analytical skills. Find characteristics.
2. Narrow the problem:
    * Break the problem down into individual issues. Find noise in the data and get rid of it.
3. Generate possible solutions:
    * Come up with several different answers to your problem. Maybe combining more than one to create a better solution, a compromise of solutions.
4. Choose the best solution:
    * Look at the pros and cons of your solution(s).

#### Decisions, decisions
It is important to know who will be making the final decisions in any given situation, and helpful to understand the principles of decision making when making them yourself. The person making decisions is usually the person implementing the solution. Input is sought or given due to experience or expertise, and should be fact based not opinion based. A decision maker should be clearly defined upfront so there is an understanding of that process, and that no one's work is influenced by that. Approval for decisions is usually based on resources, legality, history or policy.

#### Key takeaways
* Effective problem solving involves critical and creative thinking.
* Brainstorming is often a good method for generating solutions.
* Understanding the difference between the roles of deciding and providing input makes for better decisions.

#### Exercise
1. Define the problem:
    * Time management.
    * Where he wants his skill level to be.
    * Where he wants to be in his career.
    * Being there for his child in the beginning of its life.
    * Being there for his wife during child bearing
    * Putting too much pressure on the wife to raise the child
2. Narrow the problem:
    * Time management:
        * Being able to juggle caring for his family getting his degree and taking care of his responsibilities could be difficult. Which in turn could lead to increased levels of stress and put strain on him and his relationships as well as school work.
    * Where he wants his skill level to be:
        * If he doesn't get a bachelors degree he will not be as skilled a worker if he just gets an associates degree. He will have a smaller amount of knowledge and be less prepared to handle more complicated tasks. 
    * Where he wants to be in his career:
        * He will be more qualified to serve in a position as a video game designer with a better education. Having only an associates degree may lead to a greater amount of closed doors after school when looking for a job.
    * Being there for his child in the beginning of its life:
        * I'm sure it is quite important that he be there at the beginning of the child's life to support it and his wife. Increased strength of relationship without degree and decreased strength of relationship with degree.
    * Putting too much pressure on the wife to raise the child:
        * Almost the reverse of time management. In this situation the mother will be more stressed as she will likely have to spend more time taking care of the child, and will likely exhibit symptoms that indicate a strain in the relationship.
3. Generate solutions:
    * Do it. While your child is still very young focus on getting that bachelor's degree so you don't have to stress about it later. Your child almost certainly won't remember the first 1-3 years of his life, including being in the womb. The better degree will serve you well in the future. The main drawback I see is that he won't be there as much for his wife when she is pregnant and the first few months to year or so of the babies life, which would be stressful for the wife.
    * Take a fewer amount of classes. Take a smaller amount of classes per term in order to decrease the amount of time spent in school and increase the amount of time spent helping raise your child. This way you can do both and get the benefits of both with little disadvantage, in family relationships and in his career. The only drawback I see is that it will take longer, I wouldn't assume it'd be significantly longer.
    * Take online classes. Taking online classes instead of going to a physical school saves a lot of time and effort since you can take your classes from pretty much anywhere. With this solution you can even be with your family and work. Although, a drawback to that is that it could lead to a greater amount of distraction and decreased focus. This will likely have the same benefits as the previous entry.
    * Don't go. You get to focus on your career and take care of your family. You will probably not get as good a job, I would think the gap in pay would be significant in a starting role with an associates vs a bachelor' degree. 
    * Get it later. Benefits are the same as the previous entry. The drawbacks are that you will have to spend time away from your family in what may be a crucial time in the child's development, or if it's late enough and the child is in school this may have little to no impact at all on being there for his family. You also may not need it at that point and probably wouldn't be as far in his career if he just got his degree.
4. Choose the right approach
    * I think that the best approach is online school. Don't put off education and take care of your family. The only other two options I would consider are taking longer to get the degree, or taking fewer classes. Not getting the degree or getting it later doesn't seem like a good idea to me. But depending on different variables in their situation like if the wife will work, when will school start and be over, and what they might have to give up for him getting his education. Not enough information is provided to make a real decision, but ultimately I believe that online education is the best way to go.
