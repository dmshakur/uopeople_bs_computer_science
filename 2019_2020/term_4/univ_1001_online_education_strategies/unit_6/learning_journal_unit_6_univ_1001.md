When I took the VARK test for the first time, and yes this was my first time. My score was V = 12, A = 7, R = 9, K = 14. I'm not very surprised at my results, when I read the visual and kinesthetic descriptions they seemed quite spot on. I do however utilize a large amount of reading material and do a lot of writing, coding most of the time. But that is not so much a choice as it is a necessity, so I would say that I adapt because I need to, to work with the materials available and at hand. I often, and greatly in the past, have a problem with restlessness when trying to study/work on projects, but now that I think about it I may have just been pursuing a learning technique that I am not very well suited for.

## Part 2:
The visual and kinesthetic pages from the learning material both other a wealth of new information. While a lot of the information in the kinesthetic page isn't relevant, like field trips, but there are some useful examples like where it notes that one should "take notice of real-life examples and personal stories. Taking in another persons perspective and experiences could do well to serve my ability to remember and learn. When I think about information that I remember well it is often tied to another beings experience or a story that they tell. I would try to convert material, or find appropriate alternatives that fit my learning style, but with computer science, programming and other related fields require reading as there are not always alternatives. I mix it up quite a lot with my learning materials and always
