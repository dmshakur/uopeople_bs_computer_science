This concept of a function is not new to me at all, it is extremely familiar. When I was reading the first chapter of Precalculus (2011) I found the section describing functions to be confusing at first until I realized that it was trying to explain the concept in a way that would help people understand functions that weren't familiar with them. That being said, the reason why I am so familiar with them is because I am a programmer, and functions are used for everything.
#### Functions in programming
Here is a function in the programming language Julia. This is the simplest function I can imagine. The name of the function is an underscore and it doesn't do anything at all, it takes no arguments, and has absolutely no computations.
```julia
function _() # This is a function definition
end
```
#### Simplest mathematical function:
It has no arguments and returns a whole lot of nothing, for added simplicity I names it l, because an l is written with only one stroke.

\( l()=() \)

Functions are an important and essential part of programming, and while I am only in the beginning of my exploration of mathematical subjects I would think that they are probably just as essential in math, for reusability. With functions, as I am used to them, they bring about the ability to do something more than once efficiently, and save a great deal of space and headache. In programming there is a saying, DRY or don't repeat yourself. The point of this saying is to illustrate the fact that functions have a purpose and that purpose should be utilized in making code more readable. Programming would be a horrible mess without the ability to reuse code blocks, if we wanted to call anything more than once we would need to write that code block over and over again. They seem to work in pretty much the same way in programming as well as in math.

Viewing a function is possible through graphing. Usually when I want to view a line or some kind of data I will utilize Python libraries to visual numerical data. But so far as I am aware there isn't a Python package that supports the potential of a function, or as its formally called, the domain and range. So up to now I have been utilizing the website Desmos. It is fast, simple and efficient to use, but in the future if I can just use a programming language to graph functions, I will almost assuredly do so.
