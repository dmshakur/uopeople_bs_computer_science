# Learning Journal Unit 4 MATH 1280

## Part 1
#### 07/09/2020 - 07/12/2020
Laptop broke so I was 'technologically disabled for a while.
Spent the time listening to the audio limitless and taking notes on my phone, all other free time was spent job hunting.
#### 07/13/2020
Late afternoon, parts arrive to fix laptop, laptop fixed. Proceeded with taking notes on reading material for MATH 1280.
Read and took notes on Python for DevOps.
#### 07/14/2020
Read and took notes on Python for DevOps.
Finished notes and started on the discussion posts.
#### 07/15/2020
Finished discussion posts, started and finished assignment.
Attempted self-quiz only to find that a table vital to solving the last few questions wouldn't render any values or probabilities.
#### 07/16/2020
Read Python for DevOps.
Finished learning journal.

## Part 2
#### A:
The symbol $\bar{x}$ represents the sample mean.

#### B:
The symbol $\mu$ represents the population mean.

#### C:
There is no difference in calculation with $\bar{x}$ and $\mu$, there are like clothes, they only change on the surface not necessarily what we do.

## Part 3
#### A:
```R
> x
[1] 14 74 24 65 14 75 99
> prob
[1] 0.03835616 0.20273973 0.06575342 0.17808219 0.03835616 0.20547945 0.27123288
> mean <- x * prob
> mean
[1]  0.5369863 15.0027397  1.5780822 11.5753425  0.5369863 15.4109589 26.8520548
> sum(mean)
[1] 71.49315
> 
```
#### B:
Here x is the frequency and prob is the probability. The mean is simple to compute, just take those two values, x and prob, multiply them together and take the sum of those values. This operation is equivalent to the following equation: $\textrm{mean}=\sum_{i=1}^nxP(x)$.
