## Chapter 4 College Success: Listening, taking notes and remembering

#### Expectations: High school versus College
1. Your teacher will guide you | You are expected to take responsibility for your academic success.
2. Your teacher will take attendance and help you make up any missing work | You will be expected to attend and understand the material on your own.
3. Your teacher will remind you to complete assignments | Its up to you to follow the material and understand when things are needed to be know. Since the syllabus makes this clear you will rarely be reminded.
4. Each class meets with minimal homework. | Each class meets less frequently but requires much more work from each student. Generally count on 2 to 3 hours of study. It is much harder to catch up when falling behind in college.
5. High school teachers are passionate about teaching their kids. | College professors often have a greater deal of passion for their subject matter than their students. You can tap into that passion by asking questions and interacting with your teacher about the subject matter. Participating in class discussion and seeking advice during office hours will also help.
6. Daily homework assignments contribute heavily to your grade and extra credit opportunities will likely be made available | Your grade in a course may be determined primarily by one or two exams and a long-term project or paper. Poor performance on a single exam or paper can really drag down your grade. Work on your assignments early and consistently.
7. You were told what to do by a previously determined curriculum, others could have a say in your extra curricular activities as well | You determine what you learn. It is your education.

#### The four primary methods of note taking.
1. Lists
2. Outlines.
3. Concept Maps.
4. Cornell method.

Select the method of note taking that fits your instructors teaching style and your own learning style. They can be combined for maximum effect.

Eliminate distractions. Every time you are diverted from your task, you need to reboot your short-term memory, weakening the links.

## Section 4.1: Setting yourself up for success
### Learning objective:
* Identify the roles of listening and note taking in the learning cycle.

Good listening skills make you a better note taker.

Four steps of the learning cycle:
* Preparing.
* Absorbing.
* Capturing.
* Reviewing.

## Section 4.2: Are you ready for class?
### Learning objectives:
* Prepare for listening in class and taking notes.
* Use a syllabus.

Being prepared, using techniques such as visualization, is necessary for good performance in any activity even if its just listening. Going to class with confidence and thinking about how you're going to use the material can be very helpful. Also reviewing the course syllabus to find out what the instructor expects from you and how it relates to previous information.

Preparedness:
* Eating healthy food.
* Ensure you have all necessary materials for class.
* Punctuality: You will create a distraction if you are late and have trouble getting focused on your course work.
* Clear all distractions.

## Section 4.3: Are you really listening
### Learning objectives
* Listen actively in social situations and in the class environments.
* Apply strategies that make listening more effective.
* Ask good questions.

Listening is nothing more than focusing on someones speaking with the objective of understanding. Listening is an active process as opposed to hearing which is a passive process. 

Principles of active listening:
1. Focus on what is being said. Don't pre-judge. You want to understand what they are saying, you don't need to agree with it.
2. Repeat what you hear the other person say
3. If you are unsure whether or not you understand ask questions and don't make any assumptions.
4. Look for non-verbal signals such as facial expressions and body language, signifying things such as context.
5. Look for requests in things that someone might say, such as when someone portrays their dislikes for a particular subject, which could mean that they want help with it.

## Section 4.4: Got notes?
### Learning objectives
* Explain why taking notes is important
* Use the four primary methods of note taking: lists, outlines, concept maps, and the cornell method.
* Define which methods support your learning style and the instructor's teaching style.
* Apply strategies to make note taking more effective.
* Use some effective strategies if you happen to miss a class.
* Organize your notes into effective study guides.
* Use teacher handouts to complement your notes.
* Determine what to do with your notes after the course is complete.

### Note taking methods:
* Lists:
    * Description:
        * A sequential list of ideas present in the material/lecture. They can be short phrases or paragraphs going into detail.
    * When to Use:
        * As a fallback if they are not familiar with other methods. Can require a lot of writing and be difficult to keep up with the lecture.
* Outlines:
    * Description:
        * The most important ideas are placed on the left margin and supporting ideas come indented with capital letters.
    * When to Use:
        * Good for well organized material being presented by a professor.
* Concept maps:
    * Description:
        * A central idea is places in the center of the page with lines going to circles with supporting ideas.
    * When to Use:
        * Great for showing relationships.
* Cornell method:
    * Description:
        * A 2 column approach. The left column is referred to as the cue or recall column. The right column is for taking notes using the above methods, or a mixture of them. After the lecture review the notes and write down key concepts and ideas.
    * When to Use:
        * Good for prioritizing ideas and organizing review work.
#### List method:
Using the list method doesn't focus on processing information as much as the other methods. Therefore if the list method is used it is recommended to transcribe them to another method that will require the mind to readapt it to a compressed format, instead of just regurgitating the information.

#### Outline method:
Priority is the key here. Main ideas go in the left margin and all subsequent ideas are indented to the right, recursing as necessary. It is helpful to determine what information is presented before hand.

#### Concept maps:
Very similar to a decision tree. An broad subject/idea is stated in the center and branches off with arrow or line to other subsequent ideas and their own details.

#### Cornell method:
The Cornell method is useful for its flexibility. It has four components a header, footer and two columns. The header is the title and the footer is the summary. The left column is for the bigger ideas that you base off of what you write in the right column, which is where most of the note taking takes place.

When you write notes try to make connections with other classes. Try to think about what you are writing instead of having it just be a mindless exercise. 

Never use handouts like powerpoint slides as a substitute for notes as they do not involve you in the learning process.

### General note taking tips:
Be prepared. Write on only one side of the paper. Label, number and data all notes at the top of the page. When using a laptop, position it as such that you can see the instructor and white board right over your screen. Don't try to capture everything that is said. Copy anything the instructor writes on the board. Leave space between ideas. Use signals and abbreviations. Use some method for identifying your own thoughts and questions to keep them separate from what the instructor or textbook is saying. Create a symbol to use when you fall behind. Review your notes as soon after class as possible (the same day is best). Write a summary of the main ideas of the class in your own words.
