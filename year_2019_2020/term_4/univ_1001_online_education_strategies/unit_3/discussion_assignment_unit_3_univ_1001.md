## Part 1:

One thing is for sure, both the students are absolutely at fault for what they did. One could also argue that the teacher is at fault for making sure the students knew what they were supposed to do and that they did so. I would give the academic advisor a pass however as she gave the student fair warning, which should have been heeded. Now if the students had taken the time and exercised a little more discipline and put a higher priority on reading the necessary material, I'm sure they could have done a better job with writing their paper, instead of using someone else's. Not to mention the fact that they are wasting their time by not learning the material.

## Part 2:

I believe students plagiarize due to ignorance, carelessness, and inactivity to name a few. In Case Study the cause for both students receiving an F, due to plagiarism, is because they both procrastinated and took someone else's work for their own (On Course Inc.). As a result of their procrastination they were careless and idle with their time. When they couldn't finish the book reading necessary to write their paper they turned to someone else's paper, if they better managed their time and read the prerequisite material they would have done much better.

## Part 3:

In the future, I will always make good use of plagiarism checkers before submitting anything, to ensure no that there are no accidents. A second and equally important strategy is to keep track and note any ideas that stem from previously studied work, to give credit to people's work where deserved. I am new to this format and process, but I think that with focus and attention to detail it won't be all that difficult.
