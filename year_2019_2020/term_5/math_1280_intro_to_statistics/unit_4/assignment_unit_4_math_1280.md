Data:
1. Using the list of 17 numbers at the top of the page, the median of this data, rounded to two decimal places, is: 2.8.
   * All of values of \( x \) should arranged in order so the median value can be found, if \( N \) is odd then the center value will be the median, if \( N \) is even then the mean of the two center values will be the median.
2. If you find the median using the original method (paper and pencil), you have to arrange the values into numeric order (True/False): False, you don't have to, but it will be an unnecessary pain to not do so.
3. The interquartile range for this data is (round each value to 3 decimal places: 6.000. The interquartile range is the 3rd quartile minus the 2nd quartile.
4. The formula for calculating the interquartile range is \( IQR=((n+1)\frac{3}{4})-((n+1)\frac{1}{4}) \)(n.d., Educba) (show the formula and a citation to the source that you used). \( n=17 \)
5. Using techniques that we have studied in this course, the upper and lower cutoff points (rounded to three decimal places) for identifying outliers (in the given data sample) are: \( Q1-IQR1.5=-5 \) and \( Q3+IQR1.5=19 \).
6. The summary() command shows a list of outliers, if there are any (True/False): False.
7. The list of outlier values is: NA.
8. The standard deviation of the list of 17 numbers is (round to 3 decimal places): \( \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{n=1}^{i}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}=5.249 \).

A Random Variable:
1. The missing probability value (under the number 4) in the random variable table above is: 0.15.
2. The sum of the probabilities in the second row of any random variable table like the one above should equal (round to 3 decimal places): 1.000.
3. Read section 4.4.1 in the book (Yakir, 2011).  Do the numbers in the table above (for the random variable) represent a data sample (Yes/No)? Yes.
4. In the random variable table shown above, the value in the second row represents the cumulative probability of the corresponding values in the first row (True/False) False.
5. The probability that a randomly selected value from this random value will be less than or equal to 3 is : 0.60.
6. What is the probability that a randomly selected value from the random variable would be exactly 1.5? 0.
7. Review section 4.4 in the book (Yakir, 2011), especially pages 57â€”58.  The expectation of the random variable is: The sum products of \( x \) and its probability.
8. To find the expectation of a random variable by using a relative frequency table, you can add the values in the first row of the table and divide by the number of columns in the table: False.
9. Study Yakir (2011) pp. 57-59 and solved problems 4.1.6-4.1.8.  The (population) standard deviation of the random variable above is (round to 3 decimal places): 1.910.
10. If you have already calculated the standard deviation of a data sample, what is the next thing to do to find the variance: Get the square of the standard deviation.

A Population:
1. Determine how many observations in the pop3.csv file are of type a:  49949.
2. Using the appropriate R function with the default options, what is the median of the time column of pop3 (round to 3 decimal places): 4.473.
3. What is the variance of the time column of pop3 (rounded to three decimal places)? 54.916.
